## Tools and Frameworks 
The following tools and frameworks were used to design, manage, and execute the test cases: 
1- Zephyre : 
  - Zephyre was used as the primary test case management tool for organizing, executing, and tracking the test cases in this repository.
  - It provides a structured approach to defining test steps, test data, and expected results, ensuring clarity and consistency across all test cases.
         
2- CSV Format : 
  - Test cases are exported from Zephyre into .xlsx then to .csv files for version control and ease of collaboration via GitHub.
